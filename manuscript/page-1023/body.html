With forward step came on,
   And boldly to the little boy
With fearless face is gone.</p><p>"When she had taken the mantle,
With purpose for to wear,
   It shrunk up to her shoulder,
And left her back all bare.</p><p>"Then every merry knight,
That was in Arthur's court,
   Gibed and laughed and flouted,
To see that pleasant sport.</p><p>"Down she threw the mantle,
No longer bold or gay,
   But, with a face all pale and wan
To her chamber slunk away.</p><p>"Then forth came an old knight
A pattering o'er his creed,
   And proffered to the little boy
Five nobles to his meed:</p><p>"'And all the time of Christmas
Plum-porridge shall be thine,
   If thou wilt let my lady fair
Within the mantle shine.'</p></div> </div>
