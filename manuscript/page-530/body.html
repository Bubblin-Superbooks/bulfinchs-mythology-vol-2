stars of the constellation, one by one, were quenched in the light
of the moon, the poet tells us</p><p>"Down fell the red skin of the lion
   Into the river at his feet.
   His mighty club no longer beat
   The forehead of the bull; but he
   Reeled as of yore beside the sea,
   When blinded by Oenopion

And climbing up the narrow gorge,
   Fixed his blank eyes upon the sun."</p><p>Tennyson has a different theory of the Pleiads:</p><p>"Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow

   Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid."</p><p>â€”Locksley Hall.</p><p>Byron alludes to the lost Pleiad:</p><p>"Like the lost Pleiad seen no more below."</p><p>See also Mrs. Hemans's verses on the same subject.</p></div> </div>
