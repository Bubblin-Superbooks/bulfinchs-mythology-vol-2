   A phantom among men: companionless
   As the last cloud of an expiring storm,
   Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,
   Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,
   Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray
   With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness;
   And his own Thoughts, along that rugged way,
   Pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey."</code></pre><p>Stanza 31.</p><p>The allusion is probably to Shelley himself.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
