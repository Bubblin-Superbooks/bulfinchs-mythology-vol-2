divided into hunting-parties, and the dogs were let loose upon the
stag. And the last dog that was let loose was the favorite dog of
Arthur; Cavall was his name. And he left all the other dogs behind
him and turned the stag. And at the second turn the stag came

before he could be slain by any other, Arthur cut off his head.
Then they sounded the death-horn for slaying and they all gathered
round.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">They came Kadyriath to Arthur and spoke to him.</p></div> </div>
