   Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave,
   And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,
   The lover's refuge and the Lesbian's grave.
   Dark Sappho! could not verse immortal save
   That breast imbued with such immortal fire?</p><p>"'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve
   Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;" etc.</p><p>Those who wish to know more of Sappho and her "leap" are referred
to the "Spectator," Nos. 223 and 229. See also Moore's "Evenings
in Greece."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
