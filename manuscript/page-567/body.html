another branched off, narrow and rough, which led to the mountain
region. Rogero took without hesitation the narrow road; but he had
no sooner entered upon it than he was assailed by a numerous troop
which opposed his passage.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">You never have seen anything so ridiculous, so extraordinary, as

from the neck to the feet, but had the head of a monkey or a cat;
others had the legs and the ears of a horse; old men and women,
bald and hideous, ran hither and thither as if out of their
senses, half clad in the shaggy skins of beasts; one rode full

an ass or a cow; others, full of agility, skipped about, and clung
to the tails and manes of the animals which their companions rode.
