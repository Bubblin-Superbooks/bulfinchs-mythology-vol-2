earth, she was placed among the stars, where she became the
constellation Virgoâ€”the Virgin. Themis (Justice) was the mother
of Astraea. She is represented as holding aloft a pair of scales,
in which she weighs the claims of opposing parties.</p><p>It was a favorite idea of the old poets that these goddesses would

Returning Justice lift aloft her scale,
Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,
And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">See, also, Milton's "Hymn on the Nativity," stanzas</p></div> </div>
