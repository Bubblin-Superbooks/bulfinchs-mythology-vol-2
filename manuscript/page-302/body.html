masterpieces of art. The following is a translation of a Greek
epigram supposed to relate to this statue:</p><p>"To stone the gods have changed her, but in vain;
The sculptor's art has made her breathe again."</p><p>Tragic as is the story of Niobe, we cannot forbear to smile at the
use Moore has made of it in "Rhymes on the Road":</p><p>"'Twas in his carriage the sublime
Sir Richard Blackmore used to rhyme,
And, if the wits don't do him wrong,
'Twixt death and epics passed his time,
Scribbling and killing all day long;
Like Phoebus in his car at ease,
Now warbling forth a lofty song,
Now murdering the young Niobes."</p><p>Sir Richard Blackmore was a physician, and at the same time a very
prolific and very tasteless poet, whose works are now forgotten,
unless when recalled to mind by some wit like Moore for the sake
of a joke.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
