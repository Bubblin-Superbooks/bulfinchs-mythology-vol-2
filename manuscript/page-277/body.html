<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">not a voice thus warned me: 'What thou seest,
What there thou seest, fair creature, is thyself;'" etc.</p><p>â€”Paradise Lost, Book IV.</p><p>No one of the fables of antiquity has been oftener alluded to by
the poets than that of Narcissus. Here are two epigrams which
treat it in different ways. The first is by Goldsmith:</p><p>"ON A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH, STRUCK BLIND BY LIGHTNING</p><p>"Sure 'twas by Providence designed,
Rather in pity than in hate,
That he should be like Cupid blind,
To save him from Narcissus' fate."</p><p>The other is by Cowper:</p><p>"ON AN UGLY FELLOW</p><p>"Beware, my friend, of crystal brook
Or fountain, lest that hideous hook,
Thy nose, thou chance to see;
Narcissus' fate would then be thine,
And self-detested thou would'st pine,
As self-enamoured he."</p></div> </div>
