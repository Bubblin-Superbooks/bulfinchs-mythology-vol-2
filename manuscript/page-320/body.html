very form in which he knelt, with his hands outstretched and face
averted, he became fixed immovably, a mass of stone!</p><p>The following allusion to Perseus is from Milman's "Samor":</p><p>"As'mid the fabled Libyan bridal stood
Perseus in stern tranquillity of wrath,
Half stood, half floated on his ankle-plumes
Out-swelling, while the bright face on his shield
Looked into stone the raging fray; so rose,
But with no magic arms, wearing alone
Th' appalling and control of his firm look,
The Briton Samor; at his rising awe
Went abroad, and the riotous hall was mute."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
