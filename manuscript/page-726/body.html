Longfellow, in "Verses to a Child," thus relates the story:</p><p>"As great Pythagoras of yore,
   Standing beside the blacksmith's door,

   And formed the seven-chorded lyre."</p><p>See also the same poet's "Occupation of Orion"â€”</p><p>"The Samian's great Aeolian lyre."</p><p>SYBARIS AND CROTONA</p><p>Sybaris, a neighboring city to Crotona, was as celebrated for
luxury and effeminacy as Crotona for the reverse. The name has
become proverbial. J. R. Lowell uses it in this sense in his
charming little poem "To the Dandelion":</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Not in mid June the golden cuirassed bee
