held no path but as wild adventure lee him.</p><p>"My golden spurs now bring to me,
And bring to me my richest mail,
For to-morrow I go over land and sea
In search of the Holy, Holy Grail</p><p>Shall never a bed for me be spread,
   Nor shall a pillow be under my head,
   Till I begin my vow to keep.
   Here on the rushes will I sleep,
   And perchance there may come a vision true
   Ere day create the world anew"</p><p>â€”Lowell's Holy Grail.</p></div> </div>
