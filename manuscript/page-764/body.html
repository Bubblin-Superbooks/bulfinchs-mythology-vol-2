<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>In spite of all the noise of the battle, the sound of the horn
broke over it like a voice out of the other world. They say that
birds fell dead at it, and that the whole Saracen army drew back
in terror. Charlemagne was sitting in the midst of his court when
the sound reached him, and Gan was there. The Emperor was the
first to hear it.</p><p>"Do you hear that?" said he to his nobles. "Did you hear the horn
as I heard it?"</p><p>Upon this they all listened, and Gan felt his heart misgive him.
The horn sounded a second time.</p><p>"What is the meaning of this?" said Charles.</p><p>"Orlando is hunting," observed Gan, "and the stag is killed."</p><p>But when the horn sounded yet a third time, and the blast was one
of so dreadful a vehemence, everybody looked at the other, and
then they all looked at Gan in a fury. Charles rose from his seat.</p></div> </div>
