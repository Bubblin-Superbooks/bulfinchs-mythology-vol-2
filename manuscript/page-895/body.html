plains of Marathon, or whose piety would not grow warmer amid the
ruins of lona."</p><p>In the "Lord of the Isles" Scott beautifully contrasts the church
on lona with the cave of Staffa, opposite:</p><p>"Nature herself, it seemed, would raise
   A minister to her Maker's praise!
   Not for a meaner use ascend
   Her columns, or her arches bend;
   Nor of a theme less solemn tells
   That mighty surge that ebbs and swells,
   And still between each awful pause,
   From the high vault an answer draws,
   In varied tone, prolonged and high,
   That mocks the organ's melody;
   Nor doth its entrance front in vain
   To old Iona's holy fane,
   That Nature's voice might seem to say,
   Well hast thou done, frail child of clay!
   Thy humble powers that stately shrine
   Tasked high and hardâ€”but witness mine!"</p><p>KING ARTHUR AND HIS KNIGHTS</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
