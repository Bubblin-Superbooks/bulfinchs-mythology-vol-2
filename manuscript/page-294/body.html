deemed of thee." And the damsel thereupon took courage, and was
glad.</p><p>"Truly, lady," said Manawyddan, "it is not fitting for us to stay
here; we have lost our dogs, and cannot get food. Let us go into
England; it is easiest for us to find support there." "Gladly,

making shoes." "Lord," said she, "such a craft becomes not a man
so nobly born as thou." "By that however will I abide," said he.
"I know nothing thereof," said Kicva. "But I know," answered

to dress the leather, but we will buy it ready dressed, and will
make the shoes from it."</p></div> </div>
