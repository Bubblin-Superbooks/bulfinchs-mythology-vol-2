<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,
   My children fair, my lovely girls and boys;
   I will forget them; I will pass these joys,
   Ask nought so heavenward; so tooâ€”too high;
   Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die;
   To be delivered from this cumbrous flesh,
   From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,
   And merely given to the cold, bleak air.
   Have mercy, goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"</code></pre></div> </div>
