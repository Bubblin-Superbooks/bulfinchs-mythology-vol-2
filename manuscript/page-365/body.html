The strong creature from before the flood,
Without flesh, without bone,
Without vein, without blood,
Without head, without feet;
It will neither be older nor younger
   Than at the beginning.
   Behold how the sea whitens
   When first it comes,
   When it comes from the south,
   When it strikes on coasts
   It is in the field, it is in the wood,
   But the eye cannot perceive it.
   One Being has prepared it,
   By a tremendous blast,
   To wreak vengeance
   On Maelgan Gwynedd."</p><p>While he was thus singing his verse, there arose a mighty storm of
wind, so that the king and all his nobles thought that the castle
would fall upon their heads. And the king caused them to fetch
Elphin in haste from his dungeon, and placed him before Taliesin.
And it is said that immediately he sung a verse, so that the
chains opened from about his feet.</p></div> </div>
