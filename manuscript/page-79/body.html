All but the nymph that should redress his wrong,
Attend his passion and approve his song.
Like Phoebus thus, acquiring unsought praise,
He caught at love and filled his arms with bays."</p><p>The following stanza from Shelley's "Adonais" alludes to Byron's
early quarrel with the reviewers:</p><pre><code>   "The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;
   The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;
   The vultures, to the conqueror's banner true,
   Who feed where Desolation first has fed,
   And whose wings rain contagion: how they fled,
   When like Apollo, from his golden bow,
   The Pythian of the age one arrow sped
   And smiled! The spoilers tempt no second blow;
   They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them as they go."</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
