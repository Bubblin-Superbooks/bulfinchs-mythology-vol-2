of Homer, in the highest class of poetical composition, the Epic.
Virgil is far inferior to Homer in originality and invention, but
superior to him in correctness and elegance. To critics of English
lineage Milton alone of modern poets seems worthy to be classed
with these illustrious ancients. His poem of "Paradise Lost," from
which we have borrowed so many illustrations, is in many respects
equal, in some superior, to either of the great works of
antiquity. The following epigram of Dryden characterizes the three
poets with as much truth as it is usual to find in such pointed
criticism:</p><p>"ON MILTON</p><p>"Three poets in three different ages born,
   Greece, Italy, and England did adorn
   The first in loftiness of soul surpassed,
   The next in majesty, in both the last.
   The force of nature could no further go;
   To make a third she joined the other two."</p></div> </div>
