of a butterfly, along with Cupid, in the different situations
described in the allegory.</p><p>Milton alludes to the story of Cupid and Psyche in the conclusion
of his "Comus":</p><pre class="  "><code>   "Celestial Cupid, her famed son, advanced,
Holds his dear Psyche sweet entranced,
After her wandering labors long,
Till free consent the gods among
Make her his eternal bride;
And from her fair unspotted side
Two blissful twins are to be born,
Youth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn."

The allegory of the story of Cupid and Psyche is well presented in
the beautiful lines of T. K.</pre></div> </div>
