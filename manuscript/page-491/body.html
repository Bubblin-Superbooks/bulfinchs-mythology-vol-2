Which flutters from my forehead; and be blest.</p><p>"But let him not the proffered good forbear,
Nor till he seize the fleeting blessing rest;

armed with a whip, and, treading close upon his steps, scourged
him with vigorous strokes. Her name was Repentance, and she told

voice of Prudence, and seize the fairy Fortune when he might.</p></div> </div>
