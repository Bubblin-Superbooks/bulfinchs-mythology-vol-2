office was to spin the thread of human destiny, and they were
armed with shears, with which they cut it off when they pleased.
They were the daughters of Themis (Law), who sits by Jove on his
throne to give him counsel.</p><p>The Erinnyes, or Furies, were three goddesses who punished by
their secret stings the crimes of those who escaped or defied
public justice. The heads of the Furies were wreathed with

called Eumenides.</p><p>Nemesis was also an avenging goddess. She represents the righteous
anger of the gods, particularly towards the proud and insolent.</p></div> </div>
