of Cornwall, Launcelot du Lac, and Owain, the son of Urien. And
this was their characteristicâ€”that they would not retreat from
battle, neither for spear, nor for arrow, nor for sword. And
Arthur never had shame in battle the day he saw their faces there.

Kay, than to use such uncourteous speech towards a man like
Owain."</p><p>"By the hand of my friend, good lady," said Kay, "thy praise of
Owain is not greater than mine."</p></div> </div>
