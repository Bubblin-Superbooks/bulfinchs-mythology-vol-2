   Before that Merlin died, he did intend
   A brazen wall in compas to compile
   About Caermerdin, and did it commend
   Unto these sprites to bring to perfect end;

   Whom long he loved, for him in haste did send;
   Who, thereby forced his workmen to forsake,
 Them bound till his return their labor not to slack.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"In the mean time, through that false lady's train,
   He was surprised, and buried under beare,
   He ever to his work returned again;
   Nathless those fiends may not their work forbear,
   So greatly his commandement they fear;
   But there do toil and travail day and night,
   Until that brazen wall they up do rear.

 Than ever him before or after living</p></div> </div>
