<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">wench,
The violet is a nun;â€”
But I will woo the dainty rose,
The queen of every one."</p><p>The sunflower is a favorite emblem of constancy. Thus Moore uses
it:</p><p>"The heart that has truly loved never forgets,
But as truly loves on to the close;
As the sunflower turns on her god when he sets
The same look that she turned when he rose."</p></div> </div>
