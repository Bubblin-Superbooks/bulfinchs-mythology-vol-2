<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Malagigi learned from the monks that on the approaching festival
there would be a great crowd of people at court, for the prince
was going to show the ladies the famous horse Bayard that used to
belong to Rinaldo. "What!" said the pilgrim; "is Bayard there?"
"Yes," answered the monks; "the king has given him to Charlot,
and, after the prince has ridden him the king means to pass
sentence on the brothers of Rinaldo, and have them hanged." Then
Malagigi asked alms of the monks, but they would give him none,
till he threw aside his pilgrim garb, and let them see his armor,
when, partly for charity and partly for terror, they gave him a
golden cup, adorned with precious stones that sparkled in the
sunshine.</p><p>Malagigi then hastened back to Rinaldo, and told him what he had
learned.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The morning of the feast-day Rinaldo and Malagigi came to the
place where the sports were to be held.</p></div> </div>
