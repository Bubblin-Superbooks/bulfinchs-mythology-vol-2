Mauritania, was assembling an army to come and demand the
liberation of Ogier; that Guyon, King of Denmark, was prepared to

that Ogier was without strength and vigor, weakened by
imprisonment and long abstinence.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">At this crisis he received a message from Bruhier, proposing to
put the issue upon the result of a combat between himself and the
Emperor or his champion; promising, if defeated, to withdraw his
army.</p></div> </div>
