more freely; he took the harp from the maiden, and sung this lay,
with a voice broken with sobs:</p><p>"Sweet I sang in former days,
Kind love perfected my lays:
Now my art alone displays
The woe that on my being preys.</p><p>"Charming love, delicious power,
Worshipped from my earliest hour,
Thou who life on all dost shower,
Love! my life thou dost devour.</p><p>"In death's hour I beg of thee,
Isoude, dearest enemy,
Thou who erst couldst kinder be,
When I'm gone, forget not me.</p><p>"On my gravestone passers-by
Oft will read, as low I lie,
'Never wight in love could vie
With Tristram, yet she let him die.'"</p><p>Tristram, having finished his lay, wrote it off and gave it to the
damsel, conjuring her to present it to the queen.</p></div> </div>
