mistakes in his mythology. It was at the wedding of Pirithous, and
not Theseus, that the Centaurs and Lapithae quarrelled.</p><pre><code>   "Look how the crown which Ariadne wore
   Upon her ivory forehead that same day
   That Theseus her unto his bridal bore,
   Then the bold Centaurs made that bloody fray
   With the fierce Lapiths which did them dismay;
   Being now placed in the firmament,
   Through the bright heaven doth her beams display,
   And is unto the stars an ornament,
   Which round about her move in order excellent."</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
