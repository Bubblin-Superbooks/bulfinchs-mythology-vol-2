which Sophocles represents the meeting of Orestes and Electra, on
his return from Phocis. Orestes, mistaking Electra for one of the
domestics, and desirous of keeping his arrival a secret till the
hour of vengeance should arrive, produces the urn in which his
ashes are supposed to rest. Electra, believing him to be really
dead, takes the urn and, embracing it, pours forth her grief in
language full of tenderness and despair.</p><p>Milton, in one of his sonnets, says:</p><p>"... The repeated air
   Of sad Electra's poet had the power
   To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare."</p><p>This alludes to the story that when, on one occasion, the city of

to destroy it, the thought was rejected upon the accidental
quotation, by some one, of a chorus of Euripides.</p><p>TROY</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The facts relating to the city of Troy are still</p></div> </div>
