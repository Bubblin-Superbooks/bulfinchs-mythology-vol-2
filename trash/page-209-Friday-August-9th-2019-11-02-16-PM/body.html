the motion of a floating corpse:</p><p>"As shaken on his restless pillow,
His head heaves with the heaving billow,
That hand, whose motion is not life,
Yet feebly seems to menace strife,
Flung by the tossing tide on high,
Then levelled with the wave ..."</p><p>Milton in his "Hymn on the Nativity," thus alludes to the fable of
the Halcyon:</p><p>"But peaceful was the night
Wherein the Prince of light
His reign of peace upon the earth began;
The winds with wonder whist
Smoothly the waters kist
Whispering new joys to the mild ocean,
Who now hath quite forgot to rave
While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave."</p><p>Keats, also, in "Endymion," says:</p><p>"O magic sleep! O comfortable bird
That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
Till it is hushed and smooth."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
