<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Arthur, in the island
Avalonia." This story has been elegantly versified by Warton. A
popular traditional belief was long entertained among the Britons,
that Arthur was not dead, but had been carried off to be healed of
his wounds in Fairy-land, and that he would reappear to avenge his
countrymen and reinstate them in the sovereignty of Britain. In
Warton's "Ode" a bard relates to King Henry the traditional story
of Arthur's death, and closes with these lines.</p><p>"Yet in vain a paynim foe
   Armed with fate the mighty blow:
   For when he fell, the Elfin queen,
   All in secret and unseen,
   O'er the fainting hero threw
   Her mantle of ambrosial blue,
   And bade her spirits bear him far,
   In Merlin's agate-axled car,
   To her green isle's enamelled steep,
   Far in the navel of the deep.
   O'er his wounds she sprinkled dew
   From flowers that in Arabia grew.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">There he reigns a mighty king,
