<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">of which the last two may
be thus translated:</p><pre class="  "><code>  "Deep degraded to a coward's slave,
   Endless contests bore Alcides brave,
   Through the thorny path of suffering led;
   Slew the Hydra, crushed the lion's might,
   Threw himself, to bring his friend to light,
   Living, in the skiff that bears the dead.
   All the torments, every toil of earth
   Juno's hatred on him could impose,
   Well he bore them, from his fated birth
   To life's grandly mournful close.

  "Till the god, the earthly part forsaken,
   From the man in flames asunder taken,
   Drank the heavenly ether's purer breath.
   Joyous in the new unwonted lightness,
   Soared he upwards to celestial brightness,
   Earth's dark heavy burden lost in death.
