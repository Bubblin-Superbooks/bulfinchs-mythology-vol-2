   If right prophetic rolls I learn,
   Borne on victory's spreading plume,
   His ancient sceptre to resume,
   His knightly table to restore,
   And brave the tournaments of yore."</p><p>After this narration another bard came forward who recited a
different story:</p><p>"When Arthur bowed his haughty crest,
   No princess veiled in azure vest
   Snatched him, by Merlin's powerful spell,
   In groves of golden bliss to dwell;
   But when he fell, with winged speed,
   His champions, on a milk-white steed,
   From the battle's hurricane,
   Bore him to Joseph's towered fane,
   In the fair vale of Avalon;
   There, with chanted orison
   And the long blaze of tapers clear,
   The stoled fathers met the bier;
   Through the dim aisles, in order dread
   Of martial woe, the chief they led,
   And deep entombed in holy ground,
   Before the altar's solemn bound."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">![Footnote: Glastonbury Abbey, said to be founded</p></div> </div>
