   The young, the beautiful, the brave,
   The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.</p><p>O, when alone along the sky
   The turret-torch was blazing high,
   Though rising gale and breaking foam,
   And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;
   And clouds aloft and tides below,
   With signs and sounds forbade to go,
   He could not see, he would not hear
   Or sound or sight foreboding fear.
   His eye but saw that light of love,
   The only star it hailed above;
   His ear but rang with Hero's song,
   'Ye waves, divide not lovers long.'
   That tale is old, but love anew
   May nerve young hearts to prove as true."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
