Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,
But rigid looks of chaste austerity,
And noble grace that dashed brute violence
With sudden adoration and blank awe!"</p><p>Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," thus
describes the effect of frost upon the waters:</p><p>"Now blows the surly North and chills throughout
   The stiffening regions, while by stronger charms
   Than Circe e'er or fell Medea brewed,
   Each brook that wont to prattle to its banks
   Lies all bestilled and wedged betwixt its banks,
   Nor moves the withered reeds ...
   The surges baited by the fierce North-east,
   Tossing with fretful spleen their angry heads,
   E'en in the foam of all their madness struck
   To monumental ice.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Such execution,
