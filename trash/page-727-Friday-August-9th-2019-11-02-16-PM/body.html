   (His conquered Sybaris) than I when first
   From the dark green thy yellow circles burst."</p><p>A war arose between the two cities, and Sybaris was conquered and
destroyed. Milo, the celebrated athlete, led the army of Crotona.
Many stories are told of Milo's vast strength, such as his
carrying a heifer of four years old upon his shoulders and
afterwards eating the whole of it in a single day. The mode of his
death is thus related: As he was passing through a forest he saw
the trunk of a tree which had been partially split open by wood-
cutters, and attempted to rend it further; but the wood closed
upon his hands and held him fast, in which state he was attacked
and devoured by wolves.</p><p>Byron, in his "Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte," alludes to the story of
Milo:</p><p>"He who of old would rend the oak
Deemed not of the rebound;
   Chained by the trunk he vainly broke,
Alone, how looked he round!"</p></div> </div>
