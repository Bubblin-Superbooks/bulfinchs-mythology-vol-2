from an Arabic word signifying unbelievers. At Bombay the Parsees
are at this day a very active, intelligent, and wealthy class. For
purity of life, honesty, and conciliatory manners, they are
favorably distinguished. They have numerous temples to Fire, which
they adore as the symbol of the divinity.</p><p>The Persian religion makes the subject of the finest tale in
Moore's "Lalla Rookh," the "Fire Worshippers." The Gueber chief
says,</p><p>"Yes! I am of that impious race,
Those slaves of Fire, that morn and even
   Hail their creator's dwelling-place
Among the living lights of heaven;
   Yes! I am of that outcast crew
   To Iran and to vengeance true,
   Who curse the hour your Arabs came
   To desecrate our shrines of flame,
   And swear before God's burning eye,
   To break our country's chains or die."</p><p>HINDU MYTHOLOGY</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The religion of the Hindus is professedly founded</p></div> </div>
