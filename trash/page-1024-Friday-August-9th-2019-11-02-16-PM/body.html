With step demure and slow,
   And gravely to the mantle
With mincing face doth go.</p><p>"When she the same had taken
That was so fine and thin,
   It shrivelled all about her,
And showed her dainty skin.</p><p>"Ah! little did her mincing,
Or his long prayers bestead;
She had no more hung on her
Than a tassel and a thread.</p><p>"Down she threw the mantle,
With terror and dismay,
   And with a face of scarlet
To her chamber hied away.</p><p>"Sir Cradock called his lady,
And bade her to come near:
   'Come win this mantle, lady,
And do me credit here:</p><p>"'Come win this mantle, lady,
For now it shall be thine,
   If thou hast never done amiss,
Since first I made thee mine.'</p></div> </div>
