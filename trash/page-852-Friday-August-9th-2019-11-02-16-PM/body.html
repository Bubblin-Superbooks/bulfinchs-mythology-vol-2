lifeless, weep for him, then shall he return to life; but if any
one thing speak against him or refuse to weep, he shall be kept in
Hel."</p><p>Hermod then rode back to Asgard and gave an account of all he had
heard and witnessed.</p><p>The gods upon this despatched messengers throughout the world to
beg everything to weep in order that Baldur might be delivered
from Hel. All things very willingly complied with this request,
both men and every other living being, as well as earths, and
stones, and trees, and metals, just as we have all seen these
things weep when they are brought from a cold place into a hot
one. As the messengers were returning, they found an old hag named
Thaukt sitting in a cavern, and begged her to weep Baldur out of
Hel. But she answered,</p><p>"Thaukt will wail
   With dry tears
   Baldur's bale-fire.
   Let Hela keep her own."</p></div> </div>
