When of thy loss I thought, beloved wife!
   On thee too fondly did my memory hang,
And on the joys we shared in mortal life,
   The paths which we had trod,â€”these fountains, flowers;
   My new planned cities and unfinished towers.

  "'But should suspense permit the foe to cry,
"Behold they tremble! haughty their array,
   Yet of their number no one dares to die?"
In soul I swept the indignity away:
   Old frailties then recurred: but lofty thought
   In act embodied my deliverance wrought.'
