With modest grace came on;
   And now to try the wondrous charm
Courageously is gone.</p><p>"When she had ta'en the mantle,
And put it on her back,
   About the hem it seemed
To wrinkle and to crack.</p><p>"'Lie still,' she cried, 'O mantle!
And shame me not for naught;
   I'll freely own whate'er amiss
Or blameful I have wrought.</p><p>"'Once I kissed Sir Cradock
Beneath the greenwood tree;
   Once I kissed Sir Cradock's mouth,
Before he married me.'</p><p>"When she had thus her shriven,
And her worst fault had told,
   The mantle soon became her,
Right comely as it should.</p><p>"Most rich and fair of color,
Like gold it glittering shone,
   And much the knights in Arthur's court
Admired her every one."</p><p>![Footnote 1: New-fangledâ€”fond of novelty.]</p></div> </div>
