He finished his scholastic training\nat Harvard College, and after taking his degree was for a period a\nteacher in his home city. For a long time later in life he was\nemployed as an accountant in the Boston Merchants' Bank. His\nleisure time he used for further pursuit of the classical studies\nwhich he had begun at Harvard, and his chief pleasure in life lay\nin writing out the results of his reading, in simple, condensed\nform for young or busy readers. The plan he followed in this work,\nto give it the greatest possible usefulness, is set forth in the\nAuthor's Preface."

Milton abounds in similar allusions. The\nshort poem \"Comus\" contains more than thirty such, and the ode \"On\nthe Morning of the Nativity\" half as many. Through \"Paradise Lost\"\nthey are scattered profusely. This is one reason why we often hear\npersons by no means illiterate say that they cannot enjoy Milton.\nBut were these persons to add to their more solid acquirements the\neasy learning of this little volume, much of the poetry of Milton\nwhich has appeared to them \"harsh and crabbed\" would be found\n\"musical as is Apollo's lute.\" Our citations, taken from more than\ntwenty-five poets, from Spenser to Longfellow, will show how\ngeneral has been the practice of borrowing illustrations from\nmythology."

And Sir Hector\nraised up Sir Gawain, and said, \"Sir, me seemeth your quest is\ndone.\" \"It is done,\" said Sir Gawain; \"I shall seek no further.\"\nThen Gawain was borne into the castle, and unarmed, and laid in a\nrich bed, and a leech found to search his wound.

And had Sir\nLauncelot been with you as of old, this war had never begun, and\nof all this I am the cause.\" Then Sir Gawain prayed the king to\nsend for Sir Launcelot, and to cherish him above all other\nknights. And so at the hour of noon Sir Gawain yielded up his\nspirit, and then the king bade inter him in a chapel within Dover\nCastle; and there all men may see the skull of him, and the same\nwound is seen that Sir Launcelot gave him in battle."

So they met, and were agreed and accorded thoroughly. And\nwine was brought, and they drank. Right then came an adder out of\na little heath-bush, and stung a knight on the foot. And when the\nknight felt him sting, he looked down and saw the adder, and then\nhe drew his sword to slay the adder, and thought of no other harm.\nAnd when the host on both sides saw that sword drawn, they blew\ntrumpets and horns, and shouted greatly.

Therefore,\" said Arthur unto\nSir Bedivere, \"take thou Excalibar, my good sword, and go with it\nto yonder water-side; and when thou comest there I charge thee\nthrow my sword in that water, and come again and tell me what thou\nthere seest.\" \"My lord,\" said Sir Bedivere, \"your commandment\nshall be done.\" So Sir Bedivere departed, and by the way he beheld\nthat noble sword, that the pommel and the haft were all of\nprecious stones; and then he said to himself, \"If I throw this\nrich sword into the water no good shall come thereof, but only\nharm and loss.\" And then Sir Bedivere hid Excalibar under a tree.\nAnd so, as soon as he might, he came again to the king. \"What\nsawest thou there?\" said the king. \"Sir,\" he said, \"I saw\nnothing.\" \"Alas! thou hast deceived me,\" said the king. \"Go thou\nlightly again, and as thou love me, spare not to throw it in.\"\nThen Sir Bedivere went again, and took the sword in his hand to\nthrow it; but again it beseemed him but sin and shame to throw\naway that noble sword, and he hid it away again, and returned, and\ntold the king he had done his commandment. \"What sawest thou\nthere?\" said the king. \"Sir,\" he said, \"I saw nothing but waters\ndeep and waves wan.\" \"Ah, traitor untrue!\" said King Arthur, \"now\nhast thou betrayed me twice. And yet thou art named a noble\nknight, and hast been lief and dear to me. But now go again, and\ndo as I bid thee, for thy long tarrying putteth me in jeopardy of\nmy life.\" Then Sir Bedivere went to the sword, and lightly took it\nup, and went to the water-side, and he bound the girdle about the\nhilt, and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he\nmight.

But the third\nturned upon him and struck him with his club so that he split his\nshield and crushed his shoulder. But Geraint drew his sword and\ngave the giant a blow on the crown of his head, so severe, and\nfierce, and violent, that his head and his neck were split down to\nhis shoulders, and he fell dead. So Geraint left him thus and\nreturned to Enid. And when he reached the place where she was he\nfell down lifeless from his horse. Piercing and loud and thrilling\nwas the cry that Enid uttered. And she came and stood over him\nwhere he had fallen. And at the sound of her cries came the Earl\nof Limours, and they who journeyed with him, whom her lamentations\nbrought out of their road. And the earl said to Enid, \"Alas, lady,\nwhat hath befallen thee?\" \"Ah, good sir,\" said she, \"the only man\nI have loved, or ever shall love, is slain.\" Then he said to the\nother, \"And what is the cause of thy grief?\" \"They have slain my\nbeloved husband also,\" said she. \"And who was it that slew them?\"\n\"Some giants,\" she answered, \"slew my best-beloved, and the other\nknight went in pursuit of them, and came back in the state thou\nseest.\" The earl caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but\nhe thought that there still remained some life in Geraint; and to\nsee if he yet would live, he had him carried with him in the\nhollow of his shield, and upon a bier. And the two damsels went to\nthe court; and when they arrived there, Geraint was placed upon a\nlittle couch in front of the table that was in the hall. Then they\nall took off their traveling-gear, and the earl besought Enid to\ndo the same, and to clothe herself in other garments. \"I will not,\nby Heaven,\" said she. \"Ah, lady,\" said he, \"be not so sorrowful\nfor this matter.\" \"It were hard to persuade me to be otherwise,\"\nsaid she. \"I will act towards thee in such wise that thou needest\nnot be sorrowful, whether yonder knight live or die.

So he took her with him to the table against\nher will, and many times desired her to eat. \"I call Heaven to\nwitness,\" said she, \"that I will not until the man that is upon\nyonder bier shall eat likewise.\" \"Thou canst not fulfil that,\"\nsaid the earl, \"yonder man is dead already.\" \"I will prove that I\ncan,\" said she. Then he offered her a goblet of liquor. \"Drink\nthis goblet,\" he said, \"and it will cause thee to change thy\nmind.\" \"Evil betide me,\" she answered, \"if I drink aught until he\ndrink also.\" \"Truly,\" said the earl, \"it is of no more avail for\nme to be gentle with thee than ungentle.\" And he gave her a box in\nthe ear. Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek, and her\nlamentations were much greater than they had been before; for she\nconsidered in her mind, that, had Geraint been alive, he durst not\nhave struck her thus. But, behold, at the sound of her cry,\nGeraint revived from his swoon, and he sat upon the bier; and\nfinding his sword in the hollow of his shield, he rushed to the\nplace where the earl was, and struck him a fiercely-wounding,\nseverely-venomous, and sternly-smiting blow upon the crown of his\nhead, so that he clove him in twain, until his sword was staid by\nthe table. Then all left the board and fled away. And this was not\nso much through fear of the living, as through the dread they felt\nat seeing the dead man rise up to slay them. And Geraint looked\nupon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes; one was to see that\nEnid had lost her color and her wonted aspect; and the other, to\nknow that she was in the right. \"Lady,\" said he, \"knowest thou\nwhere our horses are?\" \"I know, lord, where thy horse is,\" she\nreplied, \"but I know not where is the other. Thy horse is in the\nhouse yonder.\" So he went to the house, and brought forth his\nhorse, and mounted him, and took up Enid, and placed her upon the\nhorse with him. And he rode forward. And their road lay between\ntwo hedges; and the night was gaining on the day. And lo! they saw\nbehind them the shafts of spears betwixt them and the sky, and\nthey heard the tramping of horses, and the noise of a host\napproaching. \"I hear something following us,\" said he, \"and I will\nput thee on the other side of the hedge.\" And thus he did. And\nthereupon, behold a knight pricked towards him, and couched his\nlance. When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, \"O chieftain,\nwhoever thou art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead\nman?\" \"O Heaven!\" said he, \"is it Geraint?\" \"Yes, in truth,\" said\nshe; \"and who art thou?\" \"I am Gwiffert Petit,\" said he, \"thy\nhusband's ally, coming to thy assistance, for I heard that thou\nwast in trouble. Come with me to the court of a son-in-law of my\nsister, which is near here, and thou shalt have the best medical\nassistance in the kingdom.\" \"I will do so gladly,\" said Geraint.\nAnd Enid was placed upon the horse of one of Gwiffert's squires,\nand they went forward to the baron's palace. And they were\nreceived there with gladness, and they met with hospitality and\nattention. The next morning they went to seek physicians; and it\nwas not long before they came, and they attended Geraint until he\nwas perfectly well. And while Geraint was under medical care\nGwiffert caused his armor to be repaired, until it was as good as\nit had ever been. And they remained there a month and a fortnight.\nThen they separated, and Geraint went towards his own dominions,\nand thenceforth he reigned prosperously, and his warlike fame and\nsplendor lasted with renown and honor, both to him and to Enid,\nfrom that time forward."

When they learned that the\nking was approaching they mounted a high tower, whence they could\nsee far and wide over the country. \"They first saw advancing the\nengines of war, fit for the armies of Darius or Julius Caesar.\n'There is Charlemagne,' said Didier. 'No,' said Ogier. The Lombard\nnext saw a vast body of soldiers, who filled all the plain.\n'Certainly Charles advanced with that host,' said the king. 'Not\nyet,' replied Ogier. 'What hope for us,' resumed the king, 'if he\nbrings with him a greater host than that?' At last Charles\nappeared, his head covered with an iron helmet, his hands with\niron gloves, his breast and shoulders with a cuirass of iron, his\nleft hand holding an iron lance, while his right hand grasped his\nsword. Those who went before the monarch, those who marched at his\nside, and those who followed him, all had similar arms. Iron\ncovered the fields and the roads; iron points reflected the rays\nof the sun. This iron, so hard, was borne by a people whose hearts\nwere harder still. The blaze of the weapons flashed terror into\nthe streets of the city.\""

But the light of this meteor was not\nextinguished, and reviving civilization owed much that was\npermanently beneficial to the great Emperor of the Franks. His\nruling hand is seen in the legislation of his time, as well as in\nthe administration of the laws.

The Saracens having dared to offer battle, he bore\nthe Oriflamme through the thickest of their ranks; Papillon,\nbreathing fire from his nostrils, threw them into disorder, and\nCortana, wielded by his invincible arm, soon finished their\noverthrow."

Ogier continued some time at the court, detained by the\nfavor of the king and queen; but erelong he had the pain to\nwitness the death of the king. Then it was that, impressed with\nall the perfections which he had discerned in the queen, he could\nnot withhold the tender homage of the offer of his hand. The queen\nwould perhaps have accepted it, she had even called a meeting of\nher great barons to deliberate on the proposition, when, the day\nbefore the meeting was to be held, at the moment when Ogier was\nkneeling at her feet, she perceived a crown of gold which an\ninvisible hand had placed on his brow, and in an instant a cloud\nenveloped Ogier, and he disappeared forever from her sight. It was\nMorgana, the fairy, whose jealousy was awakened at what she\nbeheld, who now resumed her power, and took him away to dwell with\nher in the island of Avalon. There, in company with the great King\nArthur of Britain, he still lives, and when his illustrious friend\nshall return to resume his ancient reign he will doubtless return\nwith him, and share his triumph."
