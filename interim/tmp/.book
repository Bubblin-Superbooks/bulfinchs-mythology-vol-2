Milton abounds in similar allusions. The\nshort poem \"Comus\" contains more than thirty such, and the ode \"On\nthe Morning of the Nativity\" half as many. Through \"Paradise Lost\"\nthey are scattered profusely. This is one reason why we often hear\npersons by no means illiterate say that they cannot enjoy Milton.\nBut were these persons to add to their more solid acquirements the\neasy learning of this little volume, much of the poetry of Milton\nwhich has appeared to them \"harsh and crabbed\" would be found\n\"musical as is Apollo's lute.\" Our citations, taken from more than\ntwenty-five poets, from Spenser to Longfellow, will show how\ngeneral has been the practice of borrowing illustrations</p>",

The time even of the young is\nclaimed by so many sciences of facts and things that little can be\nspared for set treatises on a science of mere fancy.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But may not the requisite knowledge of the subject be acquired by\nreading the ancient poets in translations?

Moreover, such sources give us only the\ndry facts without any of the charm of the original narrative; and\nwhat is a poetical myth when stripped of its poetry?

The ancient pagans,\nnot having the information on the subject which we derive from the\npages of Scripture, had their own way of telling the story, which\nis as follows:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Before earth and sea and heaven were created, all things wore one\naspect, to which we give the name of Chaos—a confused and\nshapeless mass, nothing but</p>",
  "page-54": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">dead weight, in which, however,\nslumbered the seeds of things. Earth, sea, and air were all mixed\nup together; so the earth was not solid, the sea was not fluid,\nand the air was not transparent. God and Nature at last\ninterposed, and put an end to this discord, separating earth from\nsea, and heaven from both. The fiery part, being the lightest,\nsprang up, and formed the skies; the air was next in weight and\nplace. The earth, being heavier, sank below; and the water took\nthe lowest place, and buoyed up the earth.</p><p>Here some god—it is not known which—gave his good offices in\narranging and disposing the earth. He appointed rivers and bays\ntheir places, raised mountains, scooped out valleys, distributed\nwoods, fountains, fertile fields, and stony plains. The air being\ncleared, the stars began to appear, fishes took possession of the\nsea, birds of the air, and four-footed beasts of the land.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">But a nobler animal was wanted, and Man was</p>",
  "page-55": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">made. It is not known\nwhether the creator made him of divine materials, or whether in\nthe earth, so lately separated from heaven, there lurked still\nsome heavenly seeds. Prometheus took some of this earth, and\nkneading it up with water, made man in the image of the gods. He\ngave him an upright stature, so that while all other animals turn\ntheir faces downward, and look to the earth, he raises his to\nheaven, and gazes on the stars.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Prometheus was one of the Titans, a gigantic race, who inhabited\nthe earth before the creation of man. To him and his brother\nEpimetheus was committed the office of making man, and providing\nhim and all other animals with the faculties necessary for their\npreservation. Epimetheus undertook to do this, and Prometheus was\nto overlook his work, when it was done. Epimetheus accordingly\nproceeded to bestow upon the different animals the various gifts\nof courage, strength, swiftness, sagacity; wings to one, claws</p>",
  "page-56": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">to\nanother, a shelly covering to a third, etc. But when man came to\nbe provided for, who was to be superior to all other animals,\nEpimetheus had been so prodigal of his resources that he had\nnothing left to bestow upon him. In his perplexity he resorted to\nhis brother Prometheus, who, with the aid of Minerva, went up to\nheaven, and lighted his torch at the chariot of the sun, and\nbrought down fire to man. With this gift man was more than a match\nfor all other animals. It enabled him to make weapons wherewith to\nsubdue them; tools with which to cultivate the earth; to warm his\ndwelling, so as to be comparatively independent of climate; and\nfinally to introduce the arts and to coin money, the means of\ntrade and commerce. Woman was not yet made. The story (absurd\nenough!) is that Jupiter made her, and sent her to Prometheus and\nhis brother, to punish them for their presumption in stealing fire\nfrom heaven; and man, for accepting the gift. The first</p>",

Venus gave her beauty, Mercury\npersuasion, Apollo music, etc. Thus equipped, she was conveyed to\nearth, and presented to Epimetheus, who gladly accepted her,\nthough cautioned by his brother to beware of Jupiter and his\ngifts. Epimetheus had in his house a jar, in which were kept\ncertain noxious articles, for which, in fitting man for his new\nabode, he had had no occasion. Pandora was seized with an eager\ncuriosity to know what this jar contained; and one day she slipped\noff the cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude\nof plagues for hapless man,—such as gout, rheumatism, and colic\nfor his body, and envy, spite, and revenge for his mind,—and\nscattered themselves far and wide.

There were no such things\nas swords, spears, or helmets.

War sprang up, using both as weapons; the guest was\nnot safe in his friend's house; and sons-in-law and fathers-in-\nlaw, brothers and sisters, husbands and wives, could not trust one\nanother.

Columns took\nthe place of the corner posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared\na gilded roof, the floors became marble, the doors were enriched\nwith carving and ornaments of gold. Then spoke Jupiter in\nbenignant accents: \"Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a\nhusband, speak, tell us your wishes; what favor have you to ask of\nus?\" Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few moments; then\ndeclared to the gods their united wish. \"We ask to be priests</p>",

The river nymph would have told the goddess all\nshe had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only\nventured to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her\nflight, and waft it to the feet of the mother. Ceres, seeing this,\nwas no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the\ncause, and laid the blame on the innocent land. \"Ungrateful soil,\"\nsaid she, \"which I have endowed with fertility and clothed with\nherbage and nourishing grain, no more</p>",

I am Alpheus, the god of this\nstream.' I ran, he pursued; he was not more swift than I, but he\nwas stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed. At last,\nexhausted, I cried for help to Diana. 'Help me, goddess! help your\nvotary!' The goddess heard, and wrapped me suddenly in a thick\ncloud. The river god looked now this way and now that, and twice\ncame close to me, but could not find me. 'Arethusa! Arethusa!' he\ncried. Oh, how I trembled,—like a lamb that hears the wolf\ngrowling outside the fold. A cold sweat came over me, my hair\nflowed down in streams; where my foot stood there was a pool.

She\nsat down on a bank, and looked up at the branches laden with fruit\nwhich hung over her. Opposite was an elm entwined with a vine\nloaded with swelling grapes. She praised the tree and its\nassociated vine, equally. \"But,\" said she, \"if the tree stood\nalone, and had no vine clinging to it, it would have nothing to\nattract or offer us but its useless</p>",

She waited\nwith impatience for him to speak first, and had her answer ready.\nOne day the youth, being separated from his companions, shouted\naloud, \"Who's here?\" Echo replied, \"Here.\" Narcissus looked\naround, but seeing no one called out, \"Come.\" Echo answered,\n\"Come.\" As no one came, Narcissus called again, \"Why do you shun\nme?\" Echo asked the same question. \"Let us join one another,\" said\nthe youth.

He fell in love with himself. He\nbrought his lips near to take a kiss; he plunged his arms in to\nembrace the beloved object.

  "page-668": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">chasms, from which\nsulphurous flames arise, while the ground is shaken with pent-up\nvapors, and mysterious sounds issue from the bowels of the earth.\nThe lake Avernus is supposed to fill the crater of an extinct\nvolcano. It is circular, half a mile wide, and very deep,\nsurrounded by high banks, which in Virgil's time were covered with\na gloomy forest. Mephitic vapors rise from its waters, so that no\nlife is found on its banks, and no birds fly over it. Here,\naccording to the poet, was the cave which afforded access to the\ninfernal regions, and here Aeneas offered sacrifices to the\ninfernal deities, Proserpine, Hecate, and the Furies. Then a\nroaring was heard in the earth, the woods on the hill-tops were\nshaken, and the howling of dogs announced the approach of the\ndeities. \"Now,\" said the Sibyl, \"summon up your courage, for you\nwill need it.\" She descended into the cave, and Aeneas followed.\nBefore the threshold of hell they passed through a group of beings\nwho are</p>",
  "page-669": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">enumerated as Griefs and avenging Cares, pale Diseases and\nmelancholy Age, Fear and Hunger that tempt to crime, Toil,\nPoverty, and Death,—forms horrible to view. The Furies spread\ntheir couches there, and Discord, whose hair was of vipers tied up\nwith a bloody fillet. Here also were the monsters, Briareus, with\nhis hundred arms, Hydras hissing, and Chimaeras breathing fire.\nAeneas shuddered at the sight, drew his sword and would have\nstruck, but the Sibyl restrained him. They then came to the black\nriver Cocytus, where they found the ferryman, Charon, old and\nsqualid, but strong and vigorous, who was receiving passengers of\nall kinds into his boat, magnanimous heroes, boys and unmarried\ngirls, as numerous as the leaves that fall at autumn, or the\nflocks that fly southward at the approach of winter. They stood\npressing for a passage and longing to touch the opposite shore.\nBut the stern ferryman took in only such as he chose, driving the\nrest</p>",
  "page-670": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">back. Aeneas, wondering at the sight, asked the Sibyl, \"Why\nthis discrimination?\" She answered, \"Those who are taken on board\nthe bark are the souls of those who have received due burial\nrites; the host of others who have remained unburied are not\npermitted to pass the flood, but wander a hundred years, and flit\nto and fro about the shore, till at last they are taken over.\"\nAeneas grieved at recollecting some of his own companions who had\nperished in the storm. At that moment he beheld Palinurus, his\npilot, who fell overboard and was drowned. He addressed him and\nasked him the cause of his misfortune. Palinurus replied that the\nrudder was carried away, and he, clinging to it, was swept away\nwith it. He besought Aeneas most urgently to extend to him his\nhand and take him in company to the opposite shore. But the Sibyl\nrebuked him for the wish thus to transgress the laws of Pluto; but\nconsoled him by informing him that the people of the shore where\nhis</p>",

Charon, fixing his eyes sternly upon the advancing warrior,\ndemanded by what right he, living and armed, approached that\nshore. To which the Sibyl replied that they would commit no\nviolence, that Aeneas's only object was to see his father, and\nfinally exhibited the golden branch, at sight of which Charon's\nwrath relaxed, and he made haste to turn his bark to the shore,\nand receive them on board. The boat, adapted only to the light\nfreight of bodiless spirits, groaned under the weight of the hero.\nThey were soon conveyed to the opposite shore. There they were\nencountered by the three-headed dog, Cerberus, with his necks\nbristling with snakes. He barked with all his three throats till\nthe Sibyl threw him</p>",
  "page-672": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">a medicated cake which he eagerly devoured,\nand then stretched himself out in his den and fell asleep. Aeneas\nand the Sibyl sprang to land. The first sound that struck their\nears was the wailing of young children, who had died on the\nthreshold of life, and near to these were they who had perished\nunder false charges. Minos presides over them as judge, and\nexamines the deeds of each. The next class was of those who had\ndied by their own hand, hating life and seeking refuge in death. O\nhow willingly would they now endure poverty, labor, and any other\ninfliction, if they might but return to life! Next were situated\nthe regions of sadness, divided off into retired paths, leading\nthrough groves of myrtle. Here roamed those who had fallen victims\nto unrequited love, not freed from pain even by death itself.\nAmong these, Aeneas thought he descried the form of Dido, with a\nwound still recent.

Stop, I beseech you, and refuse me not a last farewell.\" She\nstood for a moment with averted countenance, and eyes fixed on the\nground, and then silently passed on, as insensible to his\npleadings as a rock.

An iron tower stood by the gate, on which Tisiphone, the\navenging Fury, kept guard. From the city were heard groans, and\nthe sound of the scourge, the creaking of iron, and the clanking\nof chains. Aeneas, horror-struck, inquired of his guide what\ncrimes were those whose punishments produced the sounds he heard?\nThe Sibyl answered, \"Here is the</p>",

In the bottom of this pit, the Titan race,\nwho warred against the gods, lie prostrate; Salmoneus, also, who\npresumed to vie with Jupiter, and built a bridge of brass over\nwhich he drove his chariot that the sound might resemble thunder,\nlaunching flaming brands at his people in imitation of lightning,\ntill Jupiter struck him with a real thunderbolt, and taught him\nthe difference between mortal weapons and divine.

Numerous chiefs, more or less\npowerful, held local sway, as far as each could enforce his\ndominion, and occasionally those chiefs would unite for a common\nobject; but, in ordinary times, they were much more likely to be\nfound in hostility to one another. In such a state of things the\nrights of the humbler classes of society were at the mercy of\nevery assailant; and it is plain that, without some check upon</p>",
  "page-897": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">the\nlawless power of the chiefs, society must have relapsed into\nbarbarism. Such checks were found, first, in the rivalry of the\nchiefs themselves, whose mutual jealousy made them restraints upon\none another; secondly, in the influence of the Church, which, by\nevery motive, pure or selfish, was pledged to interpose for the\nprotection of the weak; and lastly, in the generosity and sense of\nright which, however crushed under the weight of passion and\nselfishness, dwell naturally in the heart of man. From this last\nsource sprang Chivalry, which framed an ideal of the heroic\ncharacter, combining invincible strength and valor, justice,\nmodesty, loyalty to superiors, courtesy to equals, compassion to\nweakness, and devotedness to the Church; an ideal which, if never\nmet with in real life, was acknowledged by all as the highest\nmodel for emulation.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The word \"Chivalry\" is derived from the French</p>",

The knight then was a mounted warrior, a man\nof rank, or in the service and maintenance of some man of rank,\ngenerally possessing some independent means of support, but often\nrelying mainly on the gratitude of those whom he served for the\nsupply of his wants, and often, no doubt, resorting to the means\nwhich power confers on its possessor.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In time of war the knight was, with his followers, in the camp of\nhis sovereign, or commanding in the field, or holding some castle\nfor him.

This contrariety of fact and theory in regard to chivalry\nwill account for the opposite impressions which exist in men's\nminds respecting it.

In the meantime, the\nesquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those\nrefinements of civility which formed what was in that age called\ncourtesy. The same castle in which they received their education\nwas usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the\npage was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of\nthe court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to\nrefer all his sentiments, words, and actions.

Modred was slain, and Arthur, mortally wounded,\nwas conveyed by sea to Glastonbury, where he died, and was buried.\nTradition preserved the memory of the place of his interment\nwithin the abbey, as we are told by Giraldus Cambrensis, who was\npresent when the grave was opened by command of Henry II. about\n1150, and saw the bones and sword of the monarch, and a leaden\ncross let into his tombstone, with the inscription in rude Roman\nletters, \"Here lies buried the famous King</p>",

And when he was unarmed, he put\noff his jerkin, and with might and force he clomb up to the\nfalcon, and tied the lunys to a rotten bough, and threw the hawk\ndown with it; and the lady got the hawk in her hand. Then suddenly\nthere came out of the castle her husband, all armed, and with his\nnaked sword in his hand, and said, \"O Knight Launcelot, now have I\ngot thee as I would,\" and stood at the boll of the tree to slay\nhim. \"Ah, lady!\" said Sir Launcelot, \"why have ye betrayed me?\"\n\"She hath done,\" said Sir Phelot, \"but as I commanded her; and\ntherefore there is none other way</p>",

And then he came lower, and\nwatched how his own horse stood; and suddenly he leapt on the\nfurther side of his horse from the knight. Then Sir Phelot lashed\nat him eagerly, meaning to have slain him. But Sir Launcelot put\naway the stroke, with the big bough, and smote Sir Phelot\ntherewith on the side of the head, so that he fell down in a swoon\nto the ground.

Then\nthere was laughing and merriment among them; and from time to time\ncame all the knights that Sir Turquine had prisoners, and they all\nhonored and worshipped Sir Launcelot.

  "page-1165": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">unfastened the\narmor, and helped Perceval to put it on, and taught him how to put\nhis foot in the stirrup, and use the spur; for Perceval had never\nused stirrup nor spur, but rode without saddle, and urged on his\nhorse with a stick. Then Owain would have had him return to the\ncourt to receive the praise that was his due; but Perceval said,\n\"I will not come to the court till I have encountered the tall man\nthat is there, to revenge the injury he did to the maiden. But\ntake thou the goblet to Queen Guenever, and tell King Arthur that,\nwherever I am, I will be his vassal, and will do him what profit\nand service I can.\" And Sir Owain went back to the court, and\nrelated all these things to Arthur and Guenever, and to all the\nhousehold.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And Perceval rode forward. And he came to a lake on the side of\nwhich was a fair castle, and on the border of the lake he saw a\nhoary-headed man sitting upon a velvet cushion, and his attendants\nwere fishing in the</p>",
  "page-1166": "<p class=\"no-indent stretch-last-line \">lake. When the hoary-headed man beheld\nPerceval approaching, he arose and went into the castle. Perceval\nrode to the castle, and the door was open, and he entered the\nhall. And the hoary-headed man received Perceval courteously, and\nasked him to sit by him on the cushion. When it was time the\ntables were set, and they went to meat. And when they had finished\ntheir meat the hoary-headed man asked Perceval if he knew how to\nfight with the sword \"I know not,\" said Perceval, \"but were I to\nbe taught, doubtless I should.\" And the hoary-headed man said to\nhim, \"I am thy uncle, thy mother's brother; I am called King\nPecheur.[Footnote: The word means both FISHER and SINNER.] Thou\nshalt remain with me a space, in order to learn the manners and\ncustoms of different countries, and courtesy and noble bearing.\nAnd this do thou remember, if thou seest aught to cause thy\nwonder, ask not the meaning of it; if no one has the courtesy to\ninform thee, the</p>",
  "page-1167": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">reproach will not fall upon thee, but upon me\nthat am thy teacher.\" While Perceval and his uncle discoursed\ntogether, Perceval beheld two youths enter the hall bearing a\ngolden cup and a spear of mighty size, with blood dropping from\nits point to the ground. And when all the company saw this they\nbegan to weep and lament. But for all that, the man did not break\noff his discourse with Perceval. And as he did not tell him the\nmeaning of what he saw, he forebore to ask him concerning it. Now\nthe cup that Perceval saw was the Sangreal, and the spear the\nsacred spear; and afterwards King Pecheur removed with those\nsacred relics into a far country.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">One evening Perceval entered a valley, and came to a hermit's\ncell; and the hermit welcomed him gladly, and there he spent the\nnight. And in the morning he arose, and when he went forth,\nbehold! a shower of snow had fallen in the night, and a hawk had\nkilled a wild-fowl in</p>",
  "page-1168": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">front of the cell. And the noise of the\nhorse had scared the hawk away, and a raven alighted on the bird.\nAnd Perceval stood and compared the blackness of the raven and the\nwhiteness of the snow and the redness of the blood to the hair of\nthe lady that best he loved, which was blacker than jet, and to\nher skin, which was whiter than the snow, and to the two red spots\nupon her cheeks, which were redder than the blood upon the snow.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Now Arthur and his household were in search of Perceval, and by\nchance they came that way. \"Know ye,\" said Arthur, \"who is the\nknight with the long spear that stands by the brook up yonder?\"\n\"Lord,\" said one of them, \"I will go and learn who he is.\" So the\nyouth came to the place where Perceval was, and asked him what he\ndid thus, and who he was. But Perceval was so intent upon his\nthought that he gave him no answer. Then the youth thrust at\nPerceval with his lance; and Perceval</p>",
  "page-1169": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">turned upon him, and struck\nhim to the ground. And when the youth returned to the king, and\ntold how rudely he had been treated, Sir Kay said, \"I will go\nmyself.\" And when he greeted Perceval, and got no answer, he spoke\nto him rudely and angrily. And Perceval thrust at him with his\nlance, and cast him down so that he broke his arm and his\nshoulder-blade. And while he lay thus stunned his horse returned\nback at a wild and prancing pace.</p><p>Then said Sir Gawain, surnamed the Golden-Tongued, because he was\nthe most courteous knight in Arthur's court: \"It is not fitting\nthat any should disturb an honorable knight from his thought\nunadvisedly; for either he is pondering some damage that he has\nsustained, or he is thinking of the lady whom best he loves. If it\nseem well to thee, lord, I will go and see if this knight has\nchanged from his thought, and if he has, I will ask him\ncourteously to come and visit thee.\"</p>",
  "page-1170": "<p class=\" stretch-last-line \">And Perceval was resting on the shaft of his spear, pondering the\nsame thought, and Sir Gawain came to him, and said: \"If I thought\nit would be as agreeable to thee as it would be to me, I would\nconverse with thee. I have also a message from Arthur unto thee,\nto pray thee to come and visit him. And two men have been before\non this errand.\" \"That is true,\" said Perceval; \"and uncourteously\nthey came. They attacked me, and I was annoyed thereat\" Then he\ntold him the thought that occupied his mind, and Gawain said,\n\"This was not an ungentle thought, and I should marvel if it were\npleasant for thee to be drawn from it.\" Then said Perceval, \"Tell\nme, is Sir Kay in Arthur's court?\" \"He is,\" said Gawain; \"and\ntruly he is the knight who fought with thee last.\" \"Verily,\" said\nPerceval, \"I am not sorry to have thus avenged the insult to the\nsmiling maiden. \"Then Perceval told him his name, and said, \"Who\nart thou?\" And he replied, \"I am Gawain.\" \"I am right glad</p>",
  "page-1171": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">to meet\nthee,\" said Perceval, \"for I have everywhere heard of thy prowess\nand uprightness; and I solicit thy fellowship.\" \"Thou shalt have\nit, by my faith; and grant me thine,\" said he. \"Gladly will I do\nso,\" answered Perceval.</p><p>So they went together to Arthur, and saluted him.</p><p>\"Behold, lord,\" said Gawain, \"him whom thou hast sought so long.\"\n\"Welcome unto thee, chieftain,\" said Arthur.
